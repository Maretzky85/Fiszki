# Despription
Fiszki project has a beginning as a project for deepening knowlage about Spring Framework in a form that will not go to drawer for forgetting. its goal its to create a learning place for those who want to use flip cards without having them carried everywhere.
In time I want this project to help people with learning all kind of stuff related to programming. 
It is possible that this project will extend that to other fields of interests in future.

## Goals for programmers:
- Deepening knowlage about Angular Framework
  
- Depeening knowlage about consuming REST API

## Main application features for users:
  - Quick and easy to acces learning place based on flip-cadrs idea
  - Multiple categories that can by selected for learning
  - Users can check choosen cards as learned, and that card will not be showed while browsing
  - Users can add new Questions
  - Users can view list of questions instead of drawing one
  
## Features that are on progress:
  - Answers can be voted for choosing best answer
  - Users can edit / delete items created by them
  - Multiple category chan be choosen for browsing
  - User can set daily / weekly goals to learn number of question or master a topic
  
### Plans:
  - Create Android App that will consume this API
